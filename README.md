# Synopsis

Red's Discord bot (by Twenty Six 26) is a nice python based discord bot. This is a cog for that bot, allowing for a voucher system to exist. This can assist admins to decide who to make members as a community grows. It also saves this state, so admins can see "who vouched for who"

# Code Example

!vouch (user)

This records a vouch that you (author) have vouched for the user (user). ! may not be your trigger, so use whatever your trigger is.

# Motivation

Couldn't find an existing voucher system, and wanted one, so I wrote it.
