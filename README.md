# Synopsis

Red's Discord bot (by Twenty Six 26) is a nice python based discord bot. This repo contains a few cogs with functionality that I personally wanted.

## Vouch

This cog is used to help guide admins who to confirm as members, or other roles. Other members can vouch for new people who connect to become members.

## Timeout

This cog will kick people from the server if they start spamming. Thresholds are configurable for how many messages need to be RX to be considered spam, when to reset the cooldown, etc.

## Announcer (new branch)

This cog's initial goal was to catch events for when members enter voice channels, and use gTTs to playback the username in the channel. (Announce new channel joins to existing members in a voice channel.) This is in development, and is not currently working.
